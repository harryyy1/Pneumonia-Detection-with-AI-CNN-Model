# Pneumonia-Detection-with-AI-CNN-Model
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with Python and Jupyter Notebook for the detection of pneumonia in medical images. Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection, and early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This AI model can assist medical professionals in identifying pneumonia in chest X-ray images with high accuracy. This model has a 82% accuracy. 

Key Features:
Utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images.
Trained on a diverse and labeled dataset of pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases.
Provides rapid and reliable pneumonia detection results.
Can potentially aid healthcare professionals in making quicker and more accurate diagnoses.

Getting Started:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter notebook to access the AI model and code.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the model, preprocess images, and perform pneumonia detection.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Google Colab
TensorFlow (for deep learning)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
