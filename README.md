# Pneumonia-Detection-with-AI-CNN-Model
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with Python and Jupyter Notebook for the detection of pneumonia in medical images. Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection, and early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This AI model can assist medical professionals in identifying pneumonia in chest X-ray images with high accuracy. This model has a 82% accuracy. 

# Key Features:
* Utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images.
* Trained on a diverse and labeled dataset of pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases.
* Provides rapid and reliable pneumonia detection results.
* Can potentially aid healthcare professionals in making quicker and more accurate diagnoses.

# Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook to access the AI model and code.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the model, preprocess images, and perform pneumonia detection.

# Dependencies:
* Python (version 3.x)
* Jupyter Notebook: This code is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment.
* NumPy: Used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
* Pandas: Used for working with dataframes, especially for loading and manipulating metadata.
* Seaborn and Matplotlib: Used for data visualization and plotting.
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow: Used for building and training neural network models.
* imgaug: Used for data augmentation techniques.
* wget: Used for downloading data from URLs within the notebook.

# Improvements for the Future:
* In the future, I'll work to expand  your dataset with a larger and more diverse set of chest X-ray images, as they can can significantly improve model performance. A diverse dataset can better capture the variations in image quality, demographics, and disease manifestations.
* Investigate more complex CNN architectures or explore newer neural network architectures designed for medical image analysis, like U-Net for segmentation tasks.
* Explore using pre-trained models with transfer learning from well-established architectures such as ResNet, Inception, or EfficientNet. Fine-tuning these models on the  pneumonia dataset can help improve accuracy.
